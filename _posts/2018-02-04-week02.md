# Cathedral
The Cathedral model takes the approach of having a singular team work in unison to create the project. The developers release incrementally with larger isolated releases (with no work published between releases). The goal with this methodology is to create bug-free and very stable releases at each of these checkpoints.

# Bazaar
The Bazaar model takes a different approach, by having a much more open community.

# Two lessons that I liked

> When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it to a competent successor

I think that this lesson is very relevant and will be applicable for a long time. Too many times the owner of a project abandons a project that could be potentially useful to many other people. Much of the time the owner just needs to put in a bit more work to find someone willing to take over the project and ensure that it will continue to be maintained.
