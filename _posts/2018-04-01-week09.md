# Questions for Danna
What is your favorite part of working at Google?

How much time do you spend on humanitarian vs non-humanitarian projects?

How does Google treat Open Source overall?

# Group Progress
Now that we are all a bit more familar with Phaser, we have decided how we will focus on our long-term goals for contributing. We've decided that we will have two focuses:

1. Creating new examples: Marcus, Matthew
- We've decided to make a top-down shooter, showing off features of Phaser that aren't in current game examples.
- Our goal is 200 LOC--we'll fit in as many features as we can within it
- We'll collaborate remotely on this.
2. Fixing broken examples: Melissa, Gabe, Daisy
- Several examples in the phaser3-examples repository are broken due to changes in the API from version 2 to version 3. As this switch was very recent, there is a lot still to fix. The documentation isn't even done yet! 
- We each have created a card in the "In Progress" column of our GitHub project detailing what sections of the API we are focusing on.
