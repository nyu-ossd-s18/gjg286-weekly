# HFOSS

Both the project I am working on for this class, and the others that I use outside of class do not really fall into the category of humanitarian software. Phaser is a game engine and has nothing to do with humanitarian issues, and most of the other OSS that I use is just used for personal applications.

# Group Project
We met last week and made progress on learning phaser and found several issues that we will be working on.

# My next steps

I will continue to look for a fix for the phaser3 Flood game example, and move on to other broken examples once I am finished.
