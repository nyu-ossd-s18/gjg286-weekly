# What I learned
The main takeaway from this course from me was the learning about how PRs work and the ability to make PRs and feel comfortable making PRs. 
I also learned how to quickly get up to speed on a project and find ways to make meaningful contributions to a project. I
also learned how to pick out projects that I am both interested in, and are good for beginners to make contributions to.

# What I wish I learned
Wish I had learned more about advanced git features and suggested work flows when working on a repository for many members. 
For ex. I know some companies use fetch and rebase to avoid clutting git history with merge commits. I also wish I learned more about how code review works
for repositories that implement public reviews.

# Remove one thing
I would remove some of the introductory lectures on git. I feel that most of the people taking this class should have already had baseline experience using git.
I think we could have focused on more advanced git usage or something else entirely.

# Add one thing
As mentioned previously, more advanced git lectures. Found bash scripting lecture interesting as well and would have enjoyed doing more.
