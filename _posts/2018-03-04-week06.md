# Team Assessment and Plan
## Strengths and Weaknesses
We are all comfortable with Javascript development.
## Meeting Slot A
2 PM Sundays

## Meeting Slot B
6 PM Wednesdays

## Milestones
1. Get familiar with using Phaser as a production tool, and get familiar with the community and what kinds of resources are already available.

2. Find a few different kinds of contributions that are feasible for me or the group to do in the next few weeks, eg. creating examples/tutorials, improving documentation, or thinking of a new feature/plugin to create.

3. Make a group plan that states what contributions we will work on and by when we should submit them.

4. From the plan, divide up the work necessary to make the contributions according to our individual strengths.
