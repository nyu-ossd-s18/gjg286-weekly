# Pull Request
Not yet finished looking for unassigned issue.

# Code Triage
## Projects I selected
- nlohmann/json
- zaphoyd/websocketpp
- hawaii-desktop/terminal

The projects I selected are all C++, because that is the langauge I am most comfortable with. Additionally, I selected the json library because I've used it before in past projects. The other two projects, I selected because they looked interesting.

I looked at two issues, one for the json project and for the websocket project.

## json
The user that reported this issue was experiencing a segfault on creation of a json object using the default constructor. Several other users tried to help him, but were unable to reproduce the issue on their own. The issue remains unresolved.

## websocketpp
This issue was less of an issue and more of a user requesting a tutorial. The reported asked how to properly shut down the server. This seemed like an incorrect usage of the issues page. No one has responded either.
