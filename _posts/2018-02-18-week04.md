## Projects I selected
- nlohmann/json
- zaphoyd/websocketpp
- hawaii-desktop/terminal

The projects I selected are all C++, because that is the langauge I am most comfortable with. Additionally, I selected the json library because I've used it before in past projects. The other two projects, I selected because they looked interesting.
