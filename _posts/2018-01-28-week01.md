# Open Source
### What comes to mind when I think about Open Source
I think of a collaborative project, often with many contributors who don't necessarily know each in real life. I also think of open source as code that is published/accessible for free, and is accessible to anyone who wants to use it.

### Pros/Cons of Open Source
Pros:
- Free or cheap to use
- Able to tweak it for you own personal use
- Usually in constant development (bug fixes, updates, etc.)
Cons:
- The initial time costs of getting an open source project started
- Coordination between developers (who might not agree on every issue)
- Open source software is also at risk of abandonment

# Four Open Source projects I regularly use

## Firefox
I regularly use the web browser Firefox. Firefox is free and open-source and developed by the Mozilla Foundation. I choose to use Firefox because it has a great reputation for security/privacy, as well as good performance. An alternative to Firefox that is free/open source is Chromium.

## Emacs
I also do most of my text editing in Emacs. More specifically GNU Emacs which was created by Richard Stallman for the GNU Project. Emacs is an extensible text editor and I have invested a lot of time tweaking my setup to my liking. One alternative to Emacs is vim.
